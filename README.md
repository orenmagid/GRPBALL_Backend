# GRPBALL

This is the frontend repository for my final project for the Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering Bootcamp: an app for scheduling and organizing pickup basketball, as well as discovering other local players and groups of players.

## Demo

You can check it out at https://grpball.herokuapp.com/. Because Heroku's <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours">free dyno hours</a> <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#dyno-sleeping">go to sleep</a> if the app hasn't been used in thirty minutes, the app may be unresponsive for about 30 secs when you first attempt to use it.

## Credits

This project uses code from several open source packages. I've listed the non-obvious ones (i.e. not Rails, React, or their dependencies) below.

On the backend:
<ul>
