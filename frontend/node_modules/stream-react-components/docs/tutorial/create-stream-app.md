# Creating a new Stream app + feed group

1.  Head on over to <https://getstream.io/dashboard>, and create an account if necessary
2.  Click the "Create App" button in the upper right, fill out and submit the form
    -   Name doesn't matter
    -   Select the server location closest to you
    -   Production vs development doesn't matter, but you'll only be able to delete data with a "development" app
3.  From within your app, click the "Add Feed Group" button in the middle, name your feed group "profile", and select a "Flat" feed
    -   Your feed group name doesn't actually matter - "profile" is just convenient, but you can name it whatever you'd like
    -   For now, only a flat feed is supported - notification and aggregated feeds will be supported soon!
    -   Realtime can be on or off
4.  At the bottom of the page, you'll see your Stream "Key" and "Secret" - you'll use those later
