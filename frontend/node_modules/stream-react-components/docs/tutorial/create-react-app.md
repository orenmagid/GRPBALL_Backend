## Creating a new React app

The easiest way to create a new React app is with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

```txt
npx create-react-app my-stream-react-components-app
cd my-stream-react-components-app
npm start
```

Now you have a `create-react-app` app running at `http://localhost:3000`.

You don't have to use `create-react-app` to use Stream's React components - you can just integrate them in like you would any other component.
